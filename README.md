# Coding-Temple-Mockup-Bootstrap
<h1>Coding Temple Mockup Student Page Website</h1>
<h3>What I did:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Set up an HTML file and connected Bootstrap framework</li>
  <li>Created a container and added 3 rows: Header Row, Navbar, Main Content</li>
  <li>Included my name on header row, using white background and bottom padding of 5 for spacing, centered it's position and made the font bold</li>
  <li>Used a bootstrap navbar with dark theme background, added container-fluid to remove the margins</li>
  <li>Separated the 2 navbar div and applied a flexbox feature which is justify-content-between to separate the "link" column from the rest</li>
  <li>Updated the Main Content by adding 2 columns with Div</li>
  <li>Left column has the sizing of 8/12 while the right column has 4/12</li>
  <li>Created a top and bottom card with bottom margin of 3 with a Title and a Subtitle</li>
  <li>Included random photo using https://picsum.photos and used a proper size for the page</li>
  <li>Added some paragraph as well with a Lorem Ipsum text</li>
  <li>Also created a card for the right column side listed with About Me, Interesting List and Follow Me</li>
  <li>Arranged the order of the rows and columns depending on the size of the screen, I used bootstrap syntax which is "order-(order number)"</li>
</ul>
